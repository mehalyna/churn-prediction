### ðŸŸ¢ **1. Objective & Problem Definition**

- **Primary Goal**:  
  Utilize machine learning models guided by utility theory to identify at-risk customers and effectively target interventions that maximize customer retention and financial outcomes (i.e., minimize churn at minimal cost).

- **Key Utility Considerations**:  
  Each customer decision (stay, churn, respond to promotion) is modeled by quantifying benefits (retention, revenue) and costs (promotional discounts, marketing expenditure).  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **2. Applying Specific Utility Theory Variant: Prospect Theory (CPT)**

**Why Prospect Theory?**  
- Churn decisions often involve uncertainty, loss aversion, and psychological biases.
- Customers perceive loss (e.g., loss of loyalty status, accrued benefits) as disproportionately painful, making Prospect Theory ideal for modeling customer decisions realistically.

**Integration into Modeling**:  
- **Reference Points**: Identify customersâ€™ reference points (existing benefits, historical spending, average satisfaction scores).
- **Loss Aversion & Reference-Dependent Utility**: Frame promotional interventions in terms of **avoiding loss** rather than acquiring gains (e.g., "Don't lose your loyalty benefits!" vs. "Earn new rewards!").
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  \[
  U(x) = \begin{cases}
  (x - r)^{\alpha}, & x \geq r \\
  -\lambda (r - x)^{\beta}, & x < r
  \end{cases}
  \]

  Where:  
  - \(x\) = outcome (e.g., perceived monetary or psychological benefit)  
  - \(r\) = reference point (current customer experience)  
  - \(\alpha, \beta\) represent sensitivity parameters for gains and losses  
  - \(\lambda\) represents loss-aversion (typically >1.0)

- **Practical use**:  
  Use ML models trained to predict how framing impacts churn probabilityâ€”customizing communications to exploit customer loss aversion.

### ðŸŸ¢ **3. Machine Learning Models with Utility Functions**

Key ML models suitable for this task include:

#### ðŸ”¹ **Cost-Sensitive Decision Trees**
- Incorporate costs (utility) directly into the tree-splitting criterion.
- Classify customers into actionable segments:
  - High utility intervention (intervention cost < customerâ€™s lifetime value, CLV).
  - Low utility intervention (intervention cost â‰¥ CLV).

- **Implementation Steps**:  
  1. Assign financial weights:  
  - Cost of False Negative (Customer churns without intervention: high revenue loss).  
  - Cost of False Positive (Unnecessary intervention: small promotional cost).
  2. Train cost-sensitive decision trees (e.g., using `scikit-learn` with custom cost matrices).

- **Expected outcome**:  
  Optimize retention spend, focusing resources efficiently.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **3. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Contextual Bandits for Promotion Optimization**

- **Why RL?**  
  RL directly learns to maximize long-term utility by discovering the optimal intervention strategy over time, through continuous experimentation.

- **Key Idea**:  
  Model the interaction with customers as sequential decisions. Each intervention (email, discount) has a reward (retained customer or revenue).

- **Mathematical Setup**:  
  - **State space**: Customer features (demographics, spend patterns, satisfaction scores).
  - **Actions**: Possible promotional offers (discounts, rewards, personalized communication).
  - **Rewards (Utility)**: Positive reward for successful retention, minus cost of interventions.

- **Practical Application**:  
  - Use a **Contextual Bandit** approach initially (single-step decision) for simplicity:
    - Each customer interaction = opportunity to test different interventions.
    - Continuously update utility of each promotional offer based on customer responses.
  - Gradually move to full RL (multi-step) for long-term campaigns and customer lifecycle management.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **4. Data-driven Methodology for Implementation**

- **ML modeling steps**:
  - Data Preprocessing (cleaning, feature engineering)
  - Model building:
    - **Cost-Sensitive Decision Trees (initial)**: Quick implementation, clear results.
    - **Bayesian Decision Models (intermediate)**: Incorporate prior knowledge (customer segments, historical campaign outcomes).
    - **RL/Contextual Bandit (advanced)**: Deploy after validating simpler methods.

- **Integration of Staff Consideration**:
  - Initially, test Cost-sensitive and Bayesian methods without additional hiring.
  - Reinforcement learning would likely require a dedicated ML engineer/data scientist specialized in sequential decision models, experimentation infrastructure, and real-time data pipelines.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **5. Recommended Mathematical Framework & Model Setup**

- **Utility-based Churn Risk (CRU) Model**:
  \[
  CRU(Customer) = P(Churn) \times CLV(Customer) - Cost(intervention)
  \]

- **Example Decision Rule**:
  - If \( CRU(Customer) > 0 \), intervene.
  - If \( CRU(Customer) \leq 0 \), do not intervene.

- **Implementation Workflow**:
  - **Step 1 (Initial)**:  
    Train predictive model (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to estimate \( P(Churn) \).
  - **Step 2** (Utility calculation):
    - Assign estimated CLV per customer (based on spending behavior).
    - Estimate intervention cost (marketing, discounts).
  - **Step 3** (Decision-making):
    - Automate intervention decisions (email discounts, personalized offers) based on highest positive utility scores.

---


### ðŸŸ¢ **Expected Impact & Evaluation**

- **Anticipated Outcome**:  
  Utility-based ML models typically achieve **15â€“30% relative churn reduction** compared to standard prediction models alone (based on industry benchmarks).
  - **Reinforcement learning/contextual bandits** can achieve even greater reductions (~25â€“40%) if effectively deployed.

- **Key Metrics for Success Evaluation**:
  - Absolute Churn Rate Reduction (%).
  - Incremental CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) growth.
  - ROI (retention profit vs. cost).

### ðŸŸ¢ **Recommended Research Plan (Roadmap)**

| 2     | Bayesian models, Uplift modeling & Experimentation   |
| 3     | Reinforcement Learning pilot (Contextual Bandits)    |
| 4     | Continuous monitoring, iteration, and scaling        |

### **âœ¨ Final Recommendations:**
- **Start simple** (cost-sensitive ML) immediately.
- Progress to **Bayesian/uplift models** for targeted promotional strategies.
- Pilot a **Contextual Bandit model (RL)** for advanced optimization.
- Evaluate incremental results; expand staffing as justified by measured ROI.
