    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Create a mathematical utility function reflecting customer decision-making, incorporating **loss aversion** and probability weighting (key aspects of CPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Theoretical Background:**\n",
    "According to CPT, utility depends on perceived gains or losses relative to a **reference point** (in this case, the customer's current satisfaction level).\n",

    "The general CPT utility formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(Customer) = w^+(P_{stay}) \\times V(\\text{Gain}) - w^-(P_{churn}) \\times V(\\text{Loss})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $w^+(·), w^-(·)$: Probability weighting functions (customers overweight low probabilities, underweight high probabilities).\n",
    "- $V(x)$: Value function, typically reflecting loss aversion (losses loom larger than equivalent gains).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Defining Parameters Practically:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reference point (r)**: Customer’s current satisfaction (`Satisfaction_Score`)\n",
    "- **Gain**: Increment in satisfaction or benefit from staying (e.g., personalized promotions)\n",
    "- **Loss**: The potential dissatisfaction or perceived negative impact of leaving (e.g., losing accumulated loyalty benefits, personalized support)\n",
