## ðŸŸ© Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:**
- Understand customer behaviors influencing churn and define variables critical for the utility function.

**Actions:**
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Mean, median, distribution analysis (e.g., age, income, spending).
- **Correlation analysis**:
  - Identify variables strongly correlated with churn.
- Segment customers based on behaviors (purchasing patterns, returns, promotions response, etc.).

**Utility-Focused Analysis:**
- Determine each customerâ€™s approximate lifetime value (CLV) from columns like:
  - `Annual_Income`, `Total_Spend`, `Years_as_Customer`, and `Average_Transaction_Amount`.
- Identify features most correlated with churn (`Satisfaction_Score`, `Num_of_Returns`, `Num_of_Support_Contacts`, `Last_Purchase_Days_Ago`) to quantify risk and utility.

## ðŸŸ© Step 2: Defining Customer Utility Functions

**Objective:**
- Create a mathematical definition of customer utility based on **Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT)**.

**Customer Utility Function (Example)**:
\[
U(Customer) = w^+(P_{\text{stay}})\times V(\text{Gain}) - w^-(P_{\text{churn}})\times V(\text{Loss})
\]

- **Reference point (r)**: Current satisfaction or status quo (use `Satisfaction_Score`).
- **Gain**: The perceived benefit from staying (continued good experience, incentives, convenience).
- **Loss**: The perceived benefits lost by leaving (loyalty points, personalized offers).

**Practical Implementation:**
- Estimate the parameters (e.g., loss aversion coefficient `Î»`, probability weighting functions `w(â€¢)`) from historical data.
- Translate the impact of `Satisfaction_Score`, `Promotion_Response`, and `Num_of_Support_Contacts` into quantifiable utilities.

## ðŸŸ© Step 3: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- **Encode categorical variables**:
  - `Gender`, `Promotion_Response`, and `Email_Opt_In` using dummy variables or one-hot encoding.
- Create engineered features like:
  - Ratio of returns (`Num_of_Returns / Num_of_Purchases`)
  - Frequency of purchase (`Num_of_Purchases`/`Last_Purchase_Days_Ago`)
  - Engagement score combining `Promotion_Response` and `Email_Opt_In`

- Calculate **Customer Utility Metrics**:
  - Compute expected CLV for each customer.
  - Compute estimated cost per customer intervention (e.g., marketing cost per offer).

## ðŸŸ© Step 4: Machine Learning with Utility Functions

Here are three ML strategies tailored explicitly to your data:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Approach A: Cost-sensitive Classification (Decision Trees / Random Forest)**

**Why?** Simple and interpretable initial approach to immediately leverage utility.

**Process:**
- Define utility (cost-sensitive) matrix:
  | Prediction / Reality | Churn (True) | Stay (False) |
  |----------------------|--------------|--------------|
  | Predict Churn        | +High utility (CLV-cost)   | -Moderate cost |
  | Predict Stay         | -High loss (lost CLV)      | +Neutral utility |

- Train decision tree model (e.g., scikit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier with class weights based on utility).

- **Expected outcome**:
  - Quickly identify high-utility intervention customers, reducing unnecessary promotional costs and maximizing CLV retained.

---

### ðŸ§© **Approach B: Bayesian Decision Model (Bayes Minimum Risk)**

**Why Bayesian?** 
Explicitly integrates probability of churn with utility, optimizing intervention decisions based on expected outcomes.

**Procedure:**
- Compute posterior churn probabilities (`P(churn)`) using a Bayesian Classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or Bayesian Network).
- Decision Rule:
  - Intervene if:  
    \[
    E[Utility] = P(churn)\times CLV - Cost_{intervention} > 0
    \]

- **Implementation Example**:
  ```python
  # Example utility decision rule
  if (churn_prob * CLV_customer - intervention_cost) > 0:
      action = 'send promotion'
  else:
      action = 'no action'
  ```

- **Expected Benefit**: Optimizes spend by selecting customers for whom intervention provides positive expected value.

---

### ðŸš€ **Approach C: Reinforcement Learning (Contextual Bandits)**

**Why RL?** Continuously learns optimal actions dynamicallyâ€”particularly effective in a setting with frequent customer interactions.

**RL Framework:**
- **State**: Customer state represented by dataset features (e.g., recency, frequency, monetary value, satisfaction).
- **Action**: Promotional incentives (discounts, loyalty benefits, emails).
- **Reward (Utility)**:  
  - Positive reward if customer retained (`CLV â€“ Cost`).
  - Negative if churned after intervention (`- Cost`).

**Contextual Bandit implementation**:
- Start simple by testing different promotions.
- Continuously update action-utility pair based on observed responses, converging to the best action for each segment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Step 3: Utility-Based Promotional Targeting**

- Prioritize customers based on highest expected incremental retention utility (`Churn Risk Ã— CLV â€“ Cost`).
- Focus resources on customers with high churn risk **and** high expected response to intervention (e.g., customers who previously responded to promotions).

**Practical Recommendation Example**:
- High CLV, moderate churn probability, high response likelihood â†’ **Target aggressively** (valuable segment, cost-effective).
- Low CLV, high churn probability, low response likelihood â†’ **Minimal/no targeting** (wasteful resources).

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **Expected Outcomes & Evaluation Metrics**

- Measure effectiveness through clear KPIs:
  - **Primary**: % churn reduction.
  - **Secondary**: Increase in retention ROI, targeted campaign effectiveness.

**Realistic targets**:
- Cost-sensitive/Bayesian: **15â€“25% churn reduction**.
- Reinforcement Learning (if effectively deployed): **25â€“40% churn reduction**.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Actionable Recommendations & Next Steps**

1. **Begin immediately** with cost-sensitive models to identify high-value, at-risk customers.
2. **Pilot Bayesian Minimum Risk models** to optimize campaign targeting effectiveness further.
3. Explore **Contextual Bandits** for continuous optimization once infrastructure and skills are ready.
4. Regularly review model outcomes and adjust utility parameters for maximum effectiveness.
